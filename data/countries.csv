Ran three scenarios – low, medium and high impact – based on assumptions of varying degrees of losses for tourist arrivals over a four-month period.Government has adopted a package of policy measures to deal with the tremendous economic impact of COVID-19 that is already starting to be felt as hotel occupancies have fallen, as cruise ship arrivals are on a 30-day hiatus, and as hotel workers are being asked to take unpaid or vacation leave. (Government Package of Policy Measures to Deal with Economic Impact of COVID-19).  $5 million government has already earmarked for healthcare response, and allocating up to an additional $11 million to cover detection, isolation, treatment and other COVID-19 mitigation activities. Government is allocating $10 million to provide for a temporary unemployment benefit, administered through the National Insurance Board, for self-employed persons working in the tourism industry. Government is making a special accommodation for those self-employed individuals in the tourism industry, given the unprecedented COVID-19 impact and will offer a sponsored unemployment assistance of $200 per week, for up to eight weeks. Individuals who are temporarily laid off because of the economic impacts of COVID-19 will be eligible for unemployment benefits, up to the regular 13-week period, if necessary<br>Source: Bahamas

Another $10 million would be spent on assisting 1,500 vulnerable families, identified by the Welfare Department and the Household Mitigation Unit.  She noted that the families would be given $600 monthly. Announced creation of the Barbados Adopt Our Families Programme. Persons who are laid off will immediately have the opportunity to get their unemployment benefits, guaranteeing them 60 per cent of their insurable earnings, up to a limit of 26 weeks.  The National Insurance Board has agreed to relax the requirement to visit the employment exchange at Warrens. The National Insurance Board will give those on short weeks 60 per cent of their earnings for those days.  For example, if a person is put on a three-day week, then the Board will pay 60 per cent of the wages the person would have earned for the other two days. For those employers who are prepared to retain three quarters of their workforce, even if some on short week, Government will defer their obligation to pay the employer’s contributions for three months, in the first instance, with the preparation to extend it for another three months if the crisis continues beyond that period. There will be a six-month payment moratorium on all existing loans and mortgages for persons and businesses who are directly affected and impacted by COVID-19.  Persons must go to their bank and work out those programmes. The commercial banks have also agreed to temporary working capital financing options for corporates and small businesses which are directly impacted by COVID-19. Government will recapitalize the Small Hotel Investment Fund with $20 million to allow small hotels to borrow and blend with other commercial funds so they can refurbish their property during this down period.  The interest rate for loans will no longer be five per cent but reduced to 3 1/2 per cent. Government will take $1 million from the Arts and Sports Development Fund to finance a programme dedicated to assisting artists, dancers and musicians create developmental content for Barbadians. The creation of a Jobs, Investment and Business Survival Programme. Government will facilitate businesses to use this pause in activity to upscale and invest so that they can come back stronger.

(Reuters, 08.04.2020)<br><br>Outside Hubei, railway stations and airports have gradually resumed operations and most provinces have resumed their inter-provincial road passenger transportation. Restrictions on public transportation and private car movement have been lifted in most cities.<br>Hubei province: Restrictions on outbound travel from Hubei province were lifted on 25 March, and restrictions in Wuhan have been lifted on 8 April. Railway and passenger flights have started to resume accordingly with the lifting of restrictions (Wuhan Tianhe International Airport resumed domestic flights on 8 April); however, international flights and flights to Beijing will remain suspended until further notice. Most areas have started to resume domestic passenger flights, trains, buses, ferries and city transportation.Those who want to leave Hubei should confirm with their destination city on the local requirements.<br>Domestic travellers who plan to stay in hotels in major cities are not subject to mandatory quarantine, but must comply with the local requirements of information registration and body temperature monitoring. For those who have residence in the destination city, they must confirm with the local residence committee about quarantine requirements as these still vary across the country. Beijing still requires all residents returning from other provinces to be quarantined at home for 14 days, and from 12 April, all incoming travellers who stay in hotels should provide a nucleic acid test certificate. Various cities and provinces also require all travellers from Wuhan to take nucleic acid tests (including Beijing, Shenzhen, Zhejiang, etc). Shanghai encourages companies to let returning staff from certain areas take nucleic acid tests.<br>A mobile application called ‘health code’ (or similar) with different colour code (typically green, yellow, red) is being used to indicate the level of movement clearance for individual users. A green code gives permission to freedom of movement while yellow or red may indicate that 7-14 days’ quarantine is required. As each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the ‘health code’ before the trip.<br>Although such restrictions are easing, many provinces and cities still have in place community 'close-off' style management which means:<br>A reduction of exit/entry access to the community.<br>Access control of visitors and visiting vehicles: ID check/registration, temperature measurement at gate, delivery service is to be picked up at the gate of community etc.<br>If there are confirmed cases in a certain community, there might be a closure of certain units/areas for quarantine depending on the severity of the local outbreak.<br>The ten land boundary control points between Hong Kong and mainland China have been closed. The authorities have suspended ferries and high-speed trains, as well as the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link and the Intercity Through Train which is served by Hung Hom Station.<br>Individuals who have visited Hubei province in the 14 days before arriving in Hong Kong are barred from entering the city.<br>All travellers entering Hong Kong are required to complete and submit health declaration forms.<br>Visitors from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are barred from entering Macao if they have visited a foreign country in the 14 days prior to arrival. If they visited Hong Kong or Taiwan in the previous 14 days, they may enter Macao but have to undergo 14 days of medical observations at a designated location. If they have not visited a foreign country, Hong Kong or Taiwan in the past 14 days, they will have to go through a 6-8-hour medical examination if they come from a region of high number of COVID-19 cases (Beijing, Chongqing, Guangdong, Henan, Shanghai or Zhejiang). Travellers who have been to Hubei province in the 14 days prior to arrival are required to present a medical certificate proving they are free from COVID-19.<br><br><br><br> <h4>Quarantine</h4> All travelers who enter China will be screened upon arrival and be subject to a 14-day quarantine. All arrivals should be prepared to complete quarantine at a government selected facility or hotel at their own expense.  Some Chinese cities and provinces, including Beijing, also require quarantine for all domestic travelers, regardless of nationality. <br>From 25 March until at least 8 April, this 14-day mandatory quarantine extends to all travellers coming from Macao (China SAR) and Taiwan (China), including residents. <h4>Sources</h4> <a href=""https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm"">https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm</a>

Each trip will nonetheless be followed by a 14-day period of compulsory quarantine upon return. <h4>Quarantine</h4> From March 31, a mandatory 14-day quarantine is now compulsory for everyone returning from abroad.  This does not pertain to transit through the country. <br>A general quarantine applies to every individual located in the Czech Republic. People are required to stay home, except for going to work and carrying out essential duties. <h4>Sources</h4> <a href=""https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm"">https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm</a>

Government reportedly will extend COVID-19 lockdown until 3 May(Reuters,09.04.2020).<br>1. Travel to Italy by any means of transport is possible only for one of the following reasons: a) documented work exigencies, b) health reasons or c) absolute urgency  <br>2. A completed self-declaration form must be handed to the airline before departing for Italy. The declaration is available at this link (please copy and paste it into your browser): <a href=""https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/04/modulo_rientro_da_estero_28mar20_eng.pdf"">https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/04/modulo_rientro_da_estero_28mar20_eng.pdf</a> <br>3. The form must specify: one of the three permitted reasons for travel, duration of stay in Italy, full address in Italy, the means of transport which will be used to reach this location from the point of entry (if using multiple dwellings, the complete address of each must be provided, and an indication of the means of transport to be used), telephone numbers- including mobile telephone. <br>4. All passengers must report their arrival to the Local Health Authority of their destination address, and are subject to health surveillance and quarantine for 14 days at this address.  <br><br>For those entering for only 3 days up to a maximum of 5 days self-quarantine is not required.  Only if exceeding the 5 days quarantine is required.  <br><br>5. Travellers entering Italy using their own or private means of transport are required to immediately report their entrance into Italy to the Local Health Authority at their place of entry and follow steps 2. to 4. above <br>6. Transit-passengers, upon embarking for travel to Italy, must submit the self-declaration which indicates- the carrier will verify- the following: i) reasons for travel and length of stay in Italy; ii) the place in Italy or another country (EU or non-EU) which is the passenger’s final destination, their travel document number and the means of transport used to reach their final destination; iii) telephone numbers, including a mobile one, at which the individual can receive any communications during their stay in Italy. <br>7. In the event that transit passengers develop Covid-19 symptoms, they must communicate this promptly to the Local Health Authority; they must also undertake quarantine if the Health Authority subsequently deems it necessary. <br>8. Carriers will obtain and verify the documentation referred to in points 3. and 4. before allowing passengers to board. They will also take the temperature of passengers and prohibit boarding to anyone who has a fever or for whom the aforementioned documentation is incomplete. Transport carriers are also required to take organizational measures to ensure an interpersonal distance, promote the use of personal protective equipment and crew and provide indications as to situations in which this equipment might be taken off. Air carriers shall equip passengers with personal protective equipment upon embarking. <br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <br>Train companies are reducing services, for both domestic and international travel. Some cross-border bus companies are also cancelling their services. Ports remain open although we understand that passengers on cruise ships will not be allowed to disembark for tourism purposes. Passenger ferry schedules remain subject to change and cancellations.<br><br>Internal restrictions:<br>The government on 9 March advised citizens at any location in Italy to stay at home except for work and necessity. People nationwide will only be able to travel in and out of the affected locations for proven work-related reasons, health reasons or emergencies with a self-certification. Infractions may be punished with fines and up to 18 months' imprisonment. Lockdown measures have been extended until 13 April, with the possibility of extension.   <br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <h4>Quarantine</h4> All individuals entering Italy by any means of transportation are obliged to self-quarantine in their home/hotel for 14 days even if they have no symptoms of Covid-19. Prohibition of movement in public places except for justifiable work reasons (commuting, public and commercial transport is allowed), basic necessities (i.e., food shopping), and health emergencies.<br>If trip to Italy is for working reasons and presence in Italy is less than 72hrs, self-isolation is not required.  In the event of infection with COVID 19, travellers should report this promptly to the local health authority. <h4>Sources</h4> IATA, WFP

(Reuters, 14.04.2020)  Train operations will remain suspended across country until 24 April; borders to remain closed for two more weeks (Express Tribune, 13.04.2020)<br><br>All international flights to Pakistan are suspended. <br>- This does not apply to diplomatic, special and flights of national carriers. They must have a special approval from the competent authority for transporting stranded passengers. Passengers will be subject to thorough checking as per established procedures (including swab testing, isolation or quarantine). <br><br>International restrictions:  <br>›The Prime Minister’s Special Assistant on National Security clarified in a press conference that there is no prohibition on outgoing passengers from Pakistan on non-PIA flights but since no carrier would be flying in, it is automatically understood that outbound traffic would be halted as well. <br>›From 21 March, all international arrivals will be required to provide a medical certificate stating the results of the COVID-19 test conducted 24 hours prior to boarding the flights. This will be requested at the point of disembarkation in Pakistan.  <br>›All travellers are required to submit a health declaration form and undergo health screening upon arrival. <br>›All land borders are closed. <br><br>Internal restrictions:  <br>Most domestic flights will be suspended from 26 March until 23.59, 21 April. Domestic flight operations to/from Islamabad International Airport (ISB) to Gilgit Airport (GIL) and Skardu (KDU) Airport are being permitted. <br><br>The National Highways and Motorways Police announced on 26 March that passenger buses and vans will be banned from the motorway network. However, vehicles carrying goods, petroleum products and daily use items with minimum staff, as well as private vehicles with maximum two passengers giving valid reason of travelling, will be allowed to enter the network. <br>Multiple provincial and territorial governments have invoked Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, so as to declare restrictions on movement, bans on public gatherings, suspensions or restrictions to business operations (except essential services) and restrictions on public transport. On 1 April, the federal government extended the current restrictions on public movement until 14 April and has asked all provincial governments to ensure implementation of the decision. Extensions to the various deadlines on provincial-level restrictions (see below for a partial list), which were initially slated to end on 7 April, can be expected in the coming days. <br><br>Islamabad Capital Territory: City authorities in the capital Islamabad have closed all markets, shopping malls, restaurants and private offices. Public offices will function from 10.00 to 16.00, except on Friday where they will function from 10.00 to 13.00.  <br><br>Punjab province: Authorities have closed all markets, shopping malls, restaurants, private offices and non-essential public offices. All non-essential gatherings are banned. Two persons per household may leave their residences to buy essential supplies. On 1 April, the authorities in Lahore announced that all stores exempted from the above restrictions, including meat shops and milk shops, will be closed at 17.00. Pharmacies, petrol pumps and certain grocery stores will be allowed to remain open during this period. <br>Sindh province: Authorities have closed all non-essential businesses, shopping malls, hotels and public entertainment areas. All shops exempted from the above restrictions will only be allowed to function from 08.00 to 17.00. There is a complete ban on non-essential movement of people from 17.00 to 08.00.   <br>Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province: Authorities in Peshawar have closed all restaurants and shops other than those selling groceries, medicine and other essential supplies. <br>Balochistan province: The authorities have closed all markets, shopping malls, private offices and non-essential public offices. There is a complete ban on all non-essential movement of people within Quetta.  <br>The Gilgit-Baltistan territorial government declared a 'home lockdown' on 23 March for an indefinite period, which will be legally enforced. Grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential services will remain open, while inter-district and intra-city public transport and non-essential shops will be closed. <br><br>Pakistan Railways announced the reduction of inter-city express trains starting 22 March.<br> <h4>Quarantine</h4> •Any person showing symptoms of COVID-19 infection will be taken into quarantine at designated government medical facilities. <h4>Sources</h4> <a href=""https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm"">https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm</a>
