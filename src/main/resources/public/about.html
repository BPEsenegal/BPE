            <p>Visualization of worldwide dynamics of covid-19-monitor. Always up-to-date using covid-19-monitor data from Johns Hopkins
                University: <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/covid-19-monitor">Data Source Repository (GitHub)</a>.

                        (Hospitalization) is set to 15%. For a limited number of countries we know the available Acute
                        Care Capacity and combine it with the total population and the current number of actual covid-19-monitor
                        Cases (without recovered and deceased).
                        The Utilization shows the load of Acute Care beds (covid-19-monitor Cases only; not taking into account
                        the "usual" load/occupancy).</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Calculated Critical Care Utilization in %:</strong> On page load
                        the default value for the percentage of confirmed cases that may need Critical Care
                        (ICU/Ventilator) is set to 5%. For a limited number of countries we know the available Critical
                        Care Capacity and combine it with the total population and the current number of actual covid-19-monitor
                        Cases (without recovered and deceased).
                        The Utilization shows the load of Critical Care beds with covid-19-monitor cases.
                        Different sources indicate that in "usual" times (without covid-19-monitor) around 80% of the critical
                        care beds are already (permanently) occupied. Which means a covid-19-monitor Critical Care bed
                        Utilization of more than 20% might indicate that the national Critical Care Capacity limit has
                        been reached.

            <h5>Disclaimer</h5>
            <p>NO GUARANTEE OF VALIDITY:
                We cannot guarantee the validity of the information found here. The content of any given data map, chart
                or
                table may recently have been changed or altered as our primary or secondary data sources may change.
                Also there is only a very limited amount of scientific data and (long-term) studies available. Some data
                might be inconsistent or contradictory or results for one country don't apply for another country.</p>
            <p>CAUTION: All calculated values are THEORETICAL values and may not reflect the real/actual values!</p>
            <p>A big question mark is also behind the number of Confirmed Cases and the estimated number of undetected
                Cases.
                While most scientists agree that there is a significant amount of undetected Cases, the numbers differ
                quite a lot between studies and countries depending on the test intensity and test regulations.
                This has a big influence on a lot of dereived and calculated values (e.g. Hospitalization, Mortality
                rate etc.)</p>
