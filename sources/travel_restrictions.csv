This does not apply to state or military aircraft, emergency landing, technical landing without disembarkation, humanitarian medical or relief flights, repatriation flights (commercial or government) and cargo flights. All flight permits granted for this period will be cancelled. Passengers will be subject to a 14-day quarantine and will be transported by an allocated vehicle to a government-designated facility upon arrival. Returning citizens and residents who are not coming from “high-risk areas”, such as countries with ongoing local transmission of COVID-19, and stay outside of the capital Bangkok or surrounding provinces, can request self-quarantine at their residences by presenting a negative test result for COVID-19. Foreigners are banned from entering Thailand until 31 May. Diplomats and members of international organisations and their families, and foreigners with valid work permits in Thailand, and some other categories of people are still able to enter as long as they obtain a fit-to-fly certificate issued not more than 72 hours before arrival. Diplomats must have a certificate of entry approved by Thai government agencies (eg. Ministry of Foreign Affairs). A State of Emergency is in place until 31 May. The decree will give the government more powers to impose restrictions. Measures may include curfew, banning of mass gatherings and allowing deployment of military forces for enforcement.
Returning citizens are required to provide a medical certificate stating their health is fit for flying (“Fit to Fly” Health Certificate) and a letter certifying their return to Thailand issued by the Royal Thai Embassy, Thai Consular Office or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If the travellers could not present the documents mentioned above, they will be denied from boarding the flight. Members of a diplomatic mission, cabin crew or essential goods transport workers are also required to produce the ‘fit-to-fly’ health certificate (in English or the official language of the country of departure), issued within 72 hours prior to arrival in the country. Additionally, a certificate of entry issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is required from members of a diplomatic mission. All incoming travellers will be screened at their port of entry. All travellers and crew members must present a completed T.8 health questionnaire and submit the required information in the AOT Airport of Thailand mobile application to the Health Control Office upon arrival. This document includes personal information and residence while in Thailand. The Interior Ministry has ordered for a maximum of one land checkpoint to be opened per border province. Only Chiang Rai will be exempted, as it borders both Myanmar and Laos. Checkpoints with Malaysia have already closed given the lockdown in Malaysia. The first Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge in Task has been closed until further notice. The border linking Kanchanaburi and Myanmar is closed. Ban Khao Din in Sa Kaeo linking Thailand to Cambodia is closed. Automatic renewal of visas will be granted for foreign nationals whose visa has expired after 26 March. This extension will be until 31 July, for all visa types. Those whose visa expired before 26 March must still apply for renewal at immigration offices.

Internal restrictions: Domestic flights will gradually resume on 1 May. A daily curfew is in place nationwide from 22.00 to 04.00. Essential services are exempted from this restriction. Under an emergency decree, over 357 checkpoints have been set up across the country to check local and international travellers for symptoms. Whilst interprovincial travel is still allowed, the measure aims to discourage people from doing so. Travellers in Thailand are required to carry their ID and have their temperature checked. On 27 April, the emergency decree was extended until 31 May. It was previously due to end on 30 April.
Under the emergency decree, entertainment venues, malls and markets in Bangkok are closed. Supermarkets, restaurants with takeaway options and pharmacies will remain open.

Reuters","Zimbabwe announced on 1 May extension of coronavirus lockdown by another two weeks (Reuters, 01.05.2020). 

1. Except for BUQ, HRE and VFA, airports are closed.
2. BUQ, HRE and VFA airports are open for the following flights:
- flights carrying staff for essential services or sick persons to hospitals and other health care providers;
- flights carrying a member of the staff of a foreign mission or agency going to or from such mission or agency, or a citizen, resident or protected subject of a foreign country going to or from a foreign mission of the country of which he or she is the citizen, resident or subject, for the purpose of obtaining services or assistance at such mission;
- flights carrying police, defence forces personnel and other enforcement officers.

Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Sunday 19 April extended a lockdown to contain the spread of the new coronavirus by two weeks. (Reuters, 19.04.2020) 

As of 16 April, all land borders remain closed except for returning residents and cargo. Returning residents will be subject to strict health screening and 21-day self-quarantine. Entry exceptions may also be applied to citizens bringing remittances from abroad.

All travellers should obtain a medical certificate proving that they are clear of COVID-19 prior to travel to Zimbabwe; there is potential, based on a passenger’s nationality and recent travel history, that they may be asked at immigration to produce such a certificate in order to be granted entry. Anecdotal evidence suggests that passengers arriving from countries without confirmed COVID-19 cases or a “low” number of cases will not be required to present a certificate, however the authorities have not produced a specific list. Furthermore, authorities have asked travellers who have recently been to or are arriving from countries such as China, Iran, Italy and South Korea, to suspend travel to Zimbabwe, as they are likely to be refused entry. For profile and itinerary-specific information, travellers are advised to contact the relevant airline, or the nearest Zimbabwean Embassy.

Internal restrictions: President Mnangagwa has classified COVID-19 as a ‘National Disaster;’ this allows authorities to deploy resources in combatting the pandemic and also allows the government to forbid gatherings exceeding 100 people. A nationwide lockdown is in place until at least 17 May. During this period, people will only be allowed to leave their home to purchase necessary supplies such as food and medicine, and seek medical care. Exceptions may be applied to farmers delivering their products to markets and citizens bringing remittances from abroad. Some internal measures will ease from 4 May; formal companies will be allowed to operate from 08.00 to 15.00 and public busses will be allowed to transport passengers provided they observe social distancing, wear masks, and that buses have thermometers to screen passengers. During the lockdown, the military will be deployed to ensure that the population complies with restrictions. Shops in Matabeleland South Province are now limiting the quantities being purchased per customer due to declining supplies of basic commodities. People are required to wear masks outside their homes.

","Government extends total quarantine in Santiago from 5 May (Prensa Latina, 04.05.2020)
1. Passengers are not allowed to enter Chile.
This does not apply to:
- nationals and residents of Chile;
- passengers bringing humanitarian help;
- passengers with a diplomatic visa and an official ID issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Chile;
- passengers with a safe-conduct.
2. Nationals and residents of Chile will be quarantined for 14 days.
 
Inbound Restrictions:Chile closed its borders (air, land and sea) to foreign travellers until further notice. The restrictions do not apply to Chilean nationals or residents, diplomatic visa holders, or those providing humanitarian aid. All returning travellers are required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Citizens of New Zealand are barred from transiting through the country unless they are permanent citizens of Chile. All passengers arriving in Chile with final destination Chile must sign and present a health declaration outlining the countries they have been to in the preceding 30 days. These are handed out by the airline prior to arrival. Those who have been to affected countries will receive additional screening. From 15 March to 30 September, landings in all Chilean passenger cruise ports are prohibited.

Outbound restrictions: There are currently no known restrictions on individuals seeking to depart the country. LATAM has resumed commercial flights between Santiago and the US.

Conditions and internal restrictions: A ‘state of emergency’ is currently in place and is expected to remain in place until 16 June. This gives the government extraordinary powers to restrict freedom of movement and assure food supply and basic services. The military is permitted to intervene and uphold order when necessary. A nightly curfew is in effect from 22.00 to 05.00 (local time). You may only move after 22.00 if you have an authorized certificate which can be requested at the police stations. Gatherings of more than ten people are prohibited. Sanitation Customs, posts manned by the armed forces and police where temperature controls are carried out, are set up throughout the country. Sanitary cords are posts guarded by the armed forces and police that do not allow the entry or exit of anyone from those cities/municipalities where they are located. Severe fines result in violation of the sanitary cords. Sanitary cords are implemented in the following locations for an indefinite period of time: Temuco, Padre las cases (Araucania region), Osorno, Chiloé (Los Lagos region), Punta Arenas, and Puerto Williams (Magallanes region).

Inbound Chinese travellers who plan to return from any of the following 26 countries should register the health information online for 14 days consecutively prior to departure. These 26 countries include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the UK and the US.
Mandatory 14-day quarantine at designated locations and nucleic acid testing for all inbound international travellers in most cities and provinces. Recent confirmed cases after 14-day quarantine have led some areas to extend the quarantine period. Beijing now recommends that all inbound international travellers should have another seven-day home observation after finishing 14 days’ quarantine. Guangxi, Heilongjiang and Yanbian (Jilin) have made similar recommendations, some of which are mandatory. 


Internal restrictions:   
Railway stations and airports have gradually resumed operations and most provinces have resumed their inter-provincial road passenger transportation. Restrictions on public transportation and private car movement have been lifted in most cities.
Hubei province: Restrictions on outbound travel from Hubei province were lifted on 25 March, and restrictions in Wuhan have been lifted on 8 April. Railway and passenger flights have started to resume accordingly with the lifting of restrictions (Wuhan Tianhe International Airport resumed domestic flights on 8 April); however, international flights and flights to/from Beijing will remain suspended until further notice. Those who want to leave Hubei should confirm with their destination city on the local requirements. Various cities and provinces require all travellers from Wuhan to take nucleic acid tests (including Shenzhen, Zhejiang, etc). Shanghai encourages employers to let returning staff from certain areas take nucleic acid tests.
Beijing: On 29 April, the Beijing government announced a new policy that business travellers and returnees who come from domestic ‘COVID-19 low risk’ areas to Beijing will NOT need the 14 days of home quarantine. People who have travelled from low risk areas to Beijing and are currently under home quarantine can halt their home quarantine and medical observation if applicable. The new Beijing policy does not apply to travellers from overseas, Hubei province or other domestic ‘medium and high risk areas’. Personnel returning from Hubei need to register information online in advance and get a negative nucleic acid test certificate before purchasing the returning ticket. After arrival, they need to show the test certificate to enter the community, follow the 14-day quarantine requirement, and take another test before lifting the quarantine. Domestic travellers planning to stay at hotels must present a ‘green’ health code. Chaoyang District has been rated as ‘high’ risk due to recent cluster cases. Travellers from 'high' risk areas are possible to face quarantine and other requirements when entering other provinces and cities. As such requirements vary across the country, travellers need to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel in advance.
Due to re-emergence of local cases in certain areas, some provinces and cities have re-enforced restrictions for domestic travellers from these areas. In Hainan province all travellers from Harbin, Suifenhe (both Heilongjiang province), and Manzhouli (Inner Mongolia) are required to provide a negative test result issued within seven days. Hainan also requires travellers from Baiyun and Yuexiu District of Guangzhou, Bao’an District of Shenzhen, and Jieyang (all Guangdong province) to take nucleic acid tests when entering. Changchun (Jilin province) requires travellers with travel history to Baiyun District of Guangzhou, Bao’an District of Shenzhen, Daowai District of Harbin, Huilai County of Jieyang, Jiaozhou (Qingdao), Nangang, Suifenhe (Mudanjiang), Xigang District of Dalian, Yuexiu District of Guangzhou, as well as Hubei province in the past 14 days, to report to the community within 24 hours upon arrival, undergo a 14-day home quarantine, and take nucleic acid tests.
A new directive has been issued providing more detailed guidance on community quarantine management, including a new clause that says for low-risk areas and communities with no cases detected, inbound travellers from non-high-risk areas are exempted from mandatory quarantine as long as they hold a ‘green’ health code and arrive directly (without a stopover in a high-risk area). As the risk levels still vary across the country, travellers are advised to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel about quarantine requirements in advance.
A mobile application called ‘health code’ (or similar) with different colour code (typically green, yellow, red) is being used to indicate the level of movement clearance for individual users. A green code gives permission to freedom of movement while yellow or red may indicate that 7-14 days’ quarantine is required. As each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the ‘health code’ before the trip. Heilongjiang announced an ‘in-city code’ in addition to the three-colour health code. Personnel with ‘in-city code’ are restricted to travel out of their current city but can move freely inside.
Although such restrictions are easing, many provinces and cities still have in place community 'close-off' style management which means:
A reduction of exit/entry access to the community.
Access control of visitors and visiting vehicles: ID check/registration, temperature measurement at gate, delivery service is to be picked up at the gate of community etc.
If there are confirmed cases in a certain community, there might be a closure of certain units/areas for quarantine depending on the severity of the local outbreak. In Heilongjiang province, re-emergence of local cases has led to strengthening of such measures.
Hong Kong: The ten land boundary control points between Hong Kong and mainland China have been closed. The authorities have suspended ferries and high-speed trains, as well as the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link and the Intercity Through Train which is served by Hung Hom Station.
Individuals who have visited Hubei province in the 14 days before arriving in Hong Kong are barred from entering the city.
Non-Hong Kong residents coming from mainland China, Macao (SAR) and Taiwan (China) will also be denied entry if they have been to any overseas countries or regions in the preceding 14 days.
All residents and non-residents coming from mainland China, Macao (SAR) and Taiwan (China) are also subject to a 14-day compulsory quarantine. However, travellers entering Hong Kong for educational or essential business purposes (subject to the approval of the local authorities) are not required to undertake compulsory quarantine at designated facilities. Exempted travellers will be required to comply with the Department of Health’s medical surveillance program.
All travellers entering Hong Kong are required to complete and submit health declaration forms.
School classes will remain suspended until at least 7 May.
A ban on public gatherings of more than four persons is in place until at least 7 May.
Entertainment and sports premises also remain closed until at least 7 May. Restaurants are required to enforce social distancing and allow only a maximum of four people to sit at a table, even though the restriction to limit restaurants’ seating capacity to half has been lifted.
