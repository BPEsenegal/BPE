","Government extends total quarantine in Santiago from 5 May (Prensa Latina, 04.05.2020)
1. Passengers are not allowed to enter Chile.
This does not apply to:
- nationals and residents of Chile;
- passengers bringing humanitarian help;
- passengers with a diplomatic visa and an official ID issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Chile;
- passengers with a safe-conduct.
2. Nationals and residents of Chile will be quarantined for 14 days.
 
Inbound Restrictions:Chile closed its borders (air, land and sea) to foreign travellers until further notice. The restrictions do not apply to Chilean nationals or residents, diplomatic visa holders, or those providing humanitarian aid. All returning travellers are required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Citizens of New Zealand are barred from transiting through the country unless they are permanent citizens of Chile. All passengers arriving in Chile with final destination Chile must sign and present a health declaration outlining the countries they have been to in the preceding 30 days. These are handed out by the airline prior to arrival. Those who have been to affected countries will receive additional screening. From 15 March to 30 September, landings in all Chilean passenger cruise ports are prohibited.

Outbound restrictions: There are currently no known restrictions on individuals seeking to depart the country. LATAM has resumed commercial flights between Santiago and the US.

Conditions and internal restrictions: A ‘state of emergency’ is currently in place and is expected to remain in place until 16 June. This gives the government extraordinary powers to restrict freedom of movement and assure food supply and basic services. The military is permitted to intervene and uphold order when necessary. A nightly curfew is in effect from 22.00 to 05.00 (local time). You may only move after 22.00 if you have an authorized certificate which can be requested at the police stations.

All land border crossings between China and Russia have been closed to travellers. Yunnan province has banned citizens from leaving the country by more than 30 land and river ports at the province’s borders with Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar. 

1. Passengers are not allowed to transit or enter China (People's Rep.).

3. Passengers arriving at Shanghai Pudong (PVG) or Shanghai Hongqiao (SHA) must undergo a Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) and a 14-day quarantine in designated places for medical observation.
- This does not apply to airline crew members.

Entry restrictions: Foreigners with visas or residence permits still valid from 28 March are restricted from entering China. This includes foreign nationals with APEC Business Travel Cards, port visas, persons who qualify for 24/72/144-hour visa free transit policies, Hainan 30 day visa-free policy, 15 day visa-free policy specified for foreign cruise-group-tour through Shanghai Port, Guangdong 144-hour visa-free transit policy for foreign tour groups from Hong Kong or Macao Special Administrative Regions and Guangxi 15 day visa-free policies for foreign tour groups from ASEAN countries. Diplomatic, Courtesy or C-Class visas will not be affected. Foreign nationals involved in necessary economic, trade, scientific or technological activities or for emergency and humanitarian needs may also apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates. All land border crossings between China and Russia have been closed to travellers. Yunnan province has banned citizens from leaving the country by more than 30 land and river ports at the province’s borders with Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar.

Internal restrictions:  Railway stations and airports have gradually resumed operations and most provinces have resumed their inter-provincial road passenger transportation. Restrictions on public transportation and private car movement have been lifted in most cities.
Hubei province: Restrictions on outbound travel from Hubei province were lifted on 25 March, and restrictions in Wuhan have been lifted on 8 April. Railway and passenger flights have started to resume accordingly with the lifting of restrictions (Wuhan Tianhe International Airport resumed domestic flights on 8 April); however, international flights and flights to/from Beijing will remain suspended until further notice. Those who want to leave Hubei should confirm with their destination city on the local requirements. Various cities and provinces require all travellers from Wuhan to take nucleic acid tests (including Shenzhen, Zhejiang, etc). Shanghai encourages employers to let returning staff from certain areas take nucleic acid tests.
Beijing: On 29 April, the Beijing government announced a new policy that business travellers and returnees who come from domestic ‘COVID-19 low risk’ areas to Beijing will NOT need the 14 days of home quarantine. People who have travelled from low risk areas to Beijing and are currently under home quarantine can halt their home quarantine and medical observation if applicable. The new Beijing policy does not apply to travellers from overseas, Hubei province or other domestic ‘medium and high risk areas’. Personnel returning from Hubei need to register information online in advance and get a negative nucleic acid test certificate before purchasing the returning ticket. After arrival, they need to show the test certificate to enter the community, follow the 14-day quarantine requirement, and take another test before lifting the quarantine. Domestic travellers planning to stay at hotels must present a ‘green’ health code. Chaoyang District has been rated as ‘high’ risk due to recent cluster cases. Travellers from 'high' risk areas are possible to face quarantine and other requirements when entering other provinces and cities. As such requirements vary across the country, travellers need to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel in advance.
As the situation continues to improve across the country, almost all the cities and provinces have declared the local risk level to be low. The latest city is Suifenhe, the border city with Russia in Heilongjiang province, who adjusted its risk level to low from May 6. However, some cities also chose to strengthen their quarantine measures due to re-emergence of local or imported cases. The latest example is Taiyuan (who did so May 3), Shanxi provincial capital, although it didn’t announce any change to its risk or response level.
A new directive has been issued providing more detailed guidance on community quarantine management, including a new clause that says for low-risk areas and communities with no cases detected, inbound travellers from non-high-risk areas are exempted from mandatory quarantine as long as they hold a ‘green’ health code and arrive directly (without a stopover in a high-risk area). As the risk levels still vary across the country, travellers are advised to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel about quarantine requirements in advance.
A mobile application called ‘health code’ (or similar) with different colour code (typically green, yellow, red) is being used to indicate the level of movement clearance for individual users. A green code gives permission to freedom of movement while yellow or red may indicate that 7-14 days’ quarantine is required. As each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the ‘health code’ before the trip. Heilongjiang announced an ‘in-city code’ in addition to the three-colour health code. Personnel with ‘in-city code’ are restricted to travel out of their current city but can move freely inside.
Although such restrictions are easing, many provinces and cities still have in place community 'close-off' style management which means:
A reduction of exit/entry access to the community.
Access control of visitors and visiting vehicles: ID check/registration, temperature measurement at gate, delivery service is to be picked up at the gate of community etc.
If there are confirmed cases in a certain community, there might be a closure of certain units/areas for quarantine depending on the severity of the local outbreak. In Heilongjiang province, re-emergence of local cases has led to strengthening of such measures.
Hong Kong: The ten land boundary control points between Hong Kong and mainland China have been closed. The authorities have suspended ferries and high-speed trains, as well as the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link and the Intercity Through Train which is served by Hung Hom Station.
Individuals who have visited Hubei province in the 14 days before arriving in Hong Kong are barred from entering the city.
Non-Hong Kong residents coming from mainland China, Macao (SAR) and Taiwan (China) will also be denied entry if they have been to any overseas countries or regions in the preceding 14 days.
All residents and non-residents coming from mainland China, Macao (SAR) and Taiwan (China) are also subject to a 14-day compulsory quarantine. However, travellers entering Hong Kong for educational or essential business purposes (subject to the approval of the local authorities) are not required to undertake compulsory quarantine at designated facilities. Exempted travellers will be required to comply with the Department of Health’s medical surveillance program.
All travellers entering Hong Kong are required to complete and submit health declaration forms.
Schools will resume in three phases from 27 May until 15 June. A ban on public gatherings of more than eight people will be applied from 8 May, increased from four persons. From 8 May, entertainment and sports premises will reopen in stages. The first stage includes reopening of entertainment venues excluding karaoke bars, nightclubs and party rooms, as well as cinemas, gyms, and beauty and massage parlours.

- flights carrying staff for essential services or sick persons to hospitals and other health care providers;
- flights carrying a member of the staff of a foreign mission or agency going to or from such mission or agency, or a citizen, resident or protected subject of a foreign country going to or from a foreign mission of the country of which he or she is the citizen, resident or subject, for the purpose of obtaining services or assistance at such mission;
- flights carrying police, defence forces personnel and other enforcement officers.

Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Sunday 19 April extended a lockdown to contain the spread of the new coronavirus by two weeks. (Reuters, 19.04.2020) 

As of 16 April, all land borders remain closed except for returning residents and cargo. Returning residents will be subject to strict health screening and 21-day self-quarantine. Entry exceptions may also be applied to citizens bringing remittances from abroad.

All travellers should obtain a medical certificate proving that they are clear of COVID-19 prior to travel to Zimbabwe; there is potential, based on a passenger’s nationality and recent travel history, that they may be asked at immigration to produce such a certificate in order to be granted entry. Anecdotal evidence suggests that passengers arriving from countries without confirmed COVID-19 cases or a “low” number of cases will not be required to present a certificate, however the authorities have not produced a specific list. Furthermore, authorities have asked travellers who have recently been to or are arriving from countries such as China, Iran, Italy and South Korea, to suspend travel to Zimbabwe, as they are likely to be refused entry. For profile and itinerary-specific information, travellers are advised to contact the relevant airline, or the nearest Zimbabwean Embassy.

Internal restrictions: President Mnangagwa has classified COVID-19 as a ‘National Disaster;’ this allows authorities to deploy resources in combatting the pandemic and also allows the government to forbid gatherings exceeding 100 people. A nationwide lockdown is in place until at least 17 May. During this period, people will only be allowed to leave their home to purchase necessary supplies such as food and medicine, and seek medical care. Exceptions may be applied to farmers delivering their products to markets and citizens bringing remittances from abroad. Some internal measures will ease from 4 May; formal companies will be allowed to operate from 08.00 to 15.00 and public busses will be allowed to transport passengers provided they observe social distancing, wear masks, and that buses have thermometers to screen passengers. During the lockdown, the military will be deployed to ensure that the population complies with restrictions.
