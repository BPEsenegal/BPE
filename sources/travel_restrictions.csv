Railway and passenger flights have started to resume accordingly with the lifting of restrictions (Wuhan Tianhe International Airport resumed domestic flights on 8 April); however, international flights and flights to/from Beijing will remain suspended until further notice. Those who want to leave Hubei should confirm with their destination city on the local requirements. 
Beijing: For personnel travelling to Beijing from other provinces, if they have fixed residence and have been given community approval, they shall be quarantined at home for 14 days, or else quarantined at designated locations. Personnel returning from Hubei need to register information online in advance and get a negative nucleic acid test certificate before purchasing the returning ticket. After arrival, they need to show the test certificate to enter the community, and follow the 14-day quarantine requirement. People travelling domestically will not be subject to quarantine if they fulfill the following requirements: 1) Stay at a hotel; 2) Have a nucleic acid test certificate stating that the person has tested negative for COVID-19, issued within seven days before arrival; 3) Have a green code on the relevant mobile application. Travellers from ‘infected areas’ are required to be quarantined at designated hotels. Travellers who enter and exit Beijing on the same day do not need to be quarantined or take nucleic acid tests. 
Some provinces and cities require travellers from specific areas to provide a negative nucleic acid test certificate to enter. Various cities and provinces require all travellers from Wuhan to take nucleic acid tests (including Shenzhen, Zhejiang, etc). Shanghai encourages employers to let returning staff from certain areas take nucleic acid tests. Due to re-emergence of local cases in Harbin and Suifenhe (both Heilongjiang province), as well as in Manzhouli (Inner Mongolia), Hainan province announced on 16 April that all travellers from these areas are required to provide a negative test result issued within seven days. Hainan also requires travellers from Baiyun and Yuexiu District of Guangzhou, Bao’an District of Shenzhen, and Jieyang (all Guangdong province) to take nucleic acid tests when entering. 
In other areas, domestic travellers with a ‘green’ health code are not subject to mandatory quarantine if they plan to stay in hotels in major cities, but must comply with the local requirements of information registration and body temperature monitoring. For those who have residence in the destination city, they must confirm with the local residence committee about quarantine requirements as these still vary across the country. 
A mobile application called ‘health code’ (or similar) with different colour code (typically green, yellow, red) is being used to indicate the level of movement clearance for individual users. A green code gives permission to freedom of movement while yellow or red may indicate that 7-14 days’ quarantine is required. As each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the ‘health code’ before the trip.
Although such restrictions are easing, many provinces and cities still have in place community 'close-off' style management which means:
A reduction of exit/entry access to the community.
Access control of visitors and visiting vehicles: ID check/registration, temperature measurement at gate, delivery service is to be picked up at the gate of community etc.
If there are confirmed cases in a certain community, there might be a closure of certain units/areas for quarantine depending on the severity of the local outbreak. In Heilongjiang province, re-emergence of local cases has led to strengthening of such measures.
The ten land boundary control points between Hong Kong and mainland China have been closed. The authorities have suspended ferries and high-speed trains, as well as the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link and the Intercity Through Train which is served by Hung Hom Station.
Individuals who have visited Hubei province in the 14 days before arriving in Hong Kong are barred from entering the city.
All travellers entering Hong Kong are required to complete and submit health declaration forms.
Visitors from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are barred from entering Macao if they have visited a foreign country in the 14 days prior to arrival. If they visited Hong Kong or Taiwan in the previous 14 days, they may enter Macao but have to undergo 14 days of medical observations at a designated location. If they have not visited a foreign country, Hong Kong or Taiwan in the past 14 days, they will have to go through a 6-8-hour medical examination if they come from a region of high number of COVID-19 cases (Beijing, Chongqing, Guangdong, Henan, Shanghai or Zhejiang). Travellers who have been to Hubei province in the 14 days prior to arrival are required to present a medical certificate proving they are free from COVID-19.
