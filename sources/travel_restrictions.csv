Outbound restrictions: There are currently no known restrictions on individuals seeking to depart the country. 

Conditions and internal restrictions: A ‘state of emergency’ is currently in place and is expected to remain in place until 16 June. This gives the government extraordinary powers to restrict freedom of movement and assure food supply and basic services. The military is permitted to intervene and uphold order when necessary. A nightly curfew is in effect from 22.00 to 05.00 (local time). You may only move after 22.00 if you have an authorized certificate (salvoconducto) which can be requested at the police stations.

Internal restrictions: Railway stations and airports have gradually resumed operations and most provinces have resumed their inter-provincial road passenger transportation. Restrictions on public transportation and private car movement have been lifted in most cities.  Hubei province: Restrictions on outbound travel from Hubei province were lifted on 25 March, and restrictions in Wuhan have been lifted on 8 April. Railway and passenger flights have started to resume accordingly with the lifting of restrictions (Wuhan Tianhe International Airport resumed domestic flights on 8 April); however, international flights and flights to/from Beijing will remain suspended until further notice. Those who want to leave Hubei should confirm with their destination city on the local requirements. Various cities and provinces require all travellers from Wuhan to take nucleic acid tests (including Shenzhen, Zhejiang, etc). Shanghai encourages employers to let returning staff from certain areas take nucleic acid tests. Beijing: On 29 April, the Beijing government announced a new policy that business travellers and returnees who come from domestic ‘COVID-19 low risk’ areas to Beijing will NOT need the 14 days of home quarantine. People who have travelled from low risk areas to Beijing and are currently under home quarantine can halt their home quarantine and medical observation if applicable. The new Beijing policy does not apply to travellers from overseas, Hubei province or other domestic ‘medium and high risk areas’. Personnel returning from Hubei need to register information online in advance and get a negative nucleic acid test certificate before purchasing the returning ticket. After arrival, they need to show the test certificate to enter the community, follow the 14-day quarantine requirement, and take another test before lifting the quarantine. Domestic travellers planning to stay at hotels must present a ‘green’ health code. Chaoyang District has been rated as ‘high’ risk due to recent cluster cases. Travellers from 'high' risk areas are possible to face quarantine and other requirements when entering other provinces and cities. As such requirements vary across the country, travellers need to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel in advance. As the situation continues to improve across the country, almost all the cities and provinces have declared the local risk level to be low. The latest city is Suifenhe, the border city with Russia in Heilongjiang province, who adjusted its risk level to low from May 6. However, some cities also chose to strengthen their quarantine measures due to re-emergence of local or imported cases. On 10 May, Shulan (Jilin province) raised its risk level to ‘high’ due to new local cases, and has re-strengthened restrictions on local movement and public gathering. Several train routes to/from Shulan have also been suspended. Another example is Taiyuan (who did so on 3 May), Shanxi provincial capital, although it didn’t announce any change to its risk or response level. In Shanghai and Guangdong, public health emergency response levels have been changed from level II to level III. A new directive has been issued providing more detailed guidance on community quarantine management, including a new clause that says for low-risk areas and communities with no cases detected, inbound travellers from non-high-risk areas are exempted from mandatory quarantine as long as they hold a ‘green’ health code and arrive directly (without a stopover in a high-risk area). As the risk levels still vary across the country, travellers are advised to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel about quarantine requirements in advance.
As each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the ‘health code’ before the trip. Heilongjiang announced an ‘in-city code’ in addition to the three-colour health code. Personnel with ‘in-city code’ are restricted to travel out of their current city but can move freely inside. Although such restrictions are easing, many provinces and cities still have in place community 'close-off' style management which means: A reduction of exit/entry access to the community.Access control of visitors and visiting vehicles: ID check/registration, temperature measurement at gate, delivery service is to be picked up at the gate of community etc.
If there are confirmed cases in a certain community, there might be a closure of certain units/areas for quarantine depending on the severity of the local outbreak. In Heilongjiang province, re-emergence of local cases has led to strengthening of such measures. On 13 May, Jilin city was announced to be ‘sealed’. Transportations services such as intercity buses and trains for Jilin city are suspended now. People who want to move out of the city need the nucleic acid test within 48 hours of travel and register the information according to official instructions.",2020-05-14 00:00:00.000000,"All travelers, who enter China will be screened upon arrival and be subject to a 14-day quarantine.

Internal restrictions:  A nationwide state of emergency (SoE) has been extended to 31 May. Meanwhile, the government on 14 May lifted the SoE in 39 out of 47 prefectures.
The SoE remains in place in the following prefectures: the capital Tokyo,
Chiba (all Kanto region), Hokkaido (Hokkaido region), Hyogo (all Kansai region), Kanagawa, Kyoto, Osaka and Saitama. Earlier, these prefectures were declared ‘special alert’ areas, where measures to contain the pandemic are focused. The measures include school closures and strongly promoting working from home or staggering commuting hours.
Under SoE, respective governors are allowed to order the closures of facilities such as schools, cinemas, departments stores as well as ban the gathering of large crowds. Essential services, such as medical facilities, pharmacies, supermarkets, convenience stores, factories, public bathhouses and restaurants, will continue to operate.
The authorities on 4 May announced gradual easing of restrictions on social and economic activities in prefectures not on ‘special alert’. Some businesses, such as restaurants and department stores that were temporarily closed resumed operations by taking social distancing measures and operating in shorter hours. Public transport such as busses, trains and taxis continue to operate, though a reduction in services can be expected.
Restrictions on social and economic activities will be eased in prefectures no longer under the SoE. Venues such as restaurants, department stores, museums and movie theatres will be gradually reopened on the condition that social distancing measures are in place.
Prior to the announcement of the state of emergency, the authorities had already requested* all people to avoid large gatherings and for those already in areas with an uptick in COVID-19 cases to stay inside their homes. While no nationwide directive to cancel events has been issued, event sponsors have been asked to consider whether events are necessary. It is expected that various public events and access to places such as entertainment places, national museums and sports stadiums will be suspended until further notice.

Each autonomous regional government will be able to modify restrictions depending on local realities and all dates remain approximate depending on the evolution of sanitary context. From 4 May, phase 0: appointment based services were allowed to reopen such as hairdressers, dentists, beauty parlours. In the Canary and Balearic islands, phase 1 will start on 4 May unlike the rest of the country (mainland) - see below.

Bookstores and museums will be allowed to operate to 40% of their capacity. Family members will be allowed to attend funerals. Small gatherings will be allowed for ‘healthy individuals, with no vulnerabilities and no underlying conditions’. Hotels may reopen past this time, with a limited guest number of a third of their capacity and without the use of common spaces. Religious places may also reopen under the same restrictions. Territories authorised to proceed in phase 1 are listed on the Ministry of Health website. From 25 May, phase 2, theatres, cinemas and other cultural locations will be open to a third of their capacity. Weddings may include family members and friends past this phase but no further details are available as of yet.

The red level applies to regions where COVID-19 cases have been confirmed within the last 14 days. Andijan, Bukhara, Fergana, Karakalpakstan, Namangan, Samarkand, Sirdarya and Tashkent (excluding Tashkent city) regions have been designated as red zones. In these regions, existing quarantine measures remain in place, including internal movement restrictions mandating that all residents stay home, except for essential purposes or for work. Only essential and approved businesses are allowed to operate, including pharmacies, grocery shops, banks, dry cleaners and notaries. People are allowed to walk near their homes, provided they maintain social distancing and wear masks.

The yellow level applies to regions where COVID-19 cases have not been confirmed within the last 14 days, but where COVID-19 patients are undergoing treatment.
