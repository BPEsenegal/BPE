# COVID-19: OpenSource Medical Supplies


Since we all know the Math (exponential growth) and the risk of community spreading getting out of control it seems we should prepare for the worst case. Statistics indicate that NZ has a quite low ICU-coverage per 100.000 Capita (below average of high-income countries). See http://www.covid19-monitor.ml for further details and country comparisons. Means: we'll need much more ventilators/respirators and spare parts to support the critical/intensive care system. The expected ventilator shortage/gap could be between 10 and up to 100 patients per ventilator at once at the peak of the wave (depending on various factors).
On the one hand we need to use 3D printers for replacing wear and tear parts as well as printing parts to bring old/decommissioned ventilators back to life.
One the other hand we need start developing and producing our own ventilators/respirators since we won't be able to source a single device from the international market. Many countries are starting or increasing the production of simple/cheap ventilators (GM in USA, McLarren in UK https://www.mclaren.com/group/news/articles/statement-mclaren-group-ventilators, Dr√§gerwerk in Germany).

## Open Questions

* Make/Model of most common ventilators/respirators used in NZ.
* Identify wear and tear parts of used ventilators (parts that can easily get reproduced by 3D-printing).
* Discuss the possibility to use splitters (2 patients on one ventilator). Design and print those splitter-valves.


## Ventilators and BYO (Build your own)

* Alternative Oxygen Sources (in case of shortage)
  * Welding Oxygen
  * Diving Oxygen
  * Aviation Oxygen
